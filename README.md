# DBA-Project-Journey

A curated repository documenting my journey to become a database administrator. It features hands-on projects, learning resources, and practical experiments covering SQL, data modeling, query optimization, and modern database systems (relational, NoSQL, and columnar). This repo is designed to serve both as a personal learning diary and as a resource for others aiming for a career in database administration.
